# mkwii-ita-auto-TT-boards

## What this does
This program was made to automatize the updating process of the Time Trial leaderboards of the Mario Kart Wii italian community.

This program fetches data from [chadsoft](https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/) and elaborates it. After that, the data gets uploaded in the database section of the italian [Time Trial Leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pzvXA5NeHaqgaUe5ft_d4TauEbX9lVFxVp3dM51HsuA/edit#gid=0), which is a Google Sheet.

## What's going to do
In the future I would like to implement a system to automatize the updating process of the FLAPs (short for Fast LAP).
Though, they're store in a different way inside the chadsoft database, and so it won't be immediate to do so.

In the short term, I will improve the user interface, add log files and the ability to automatically save the ghosts found.

## Donate
I'm working on this project for free in my spare time, but consider a small donation if it was useful to you, to help me continue developing it.
Thank you.
