## What this does
This program was made to automatize the updating process of the Time Trial leaderboards of the Mario Kart Wii Italian community.  This program fetches data from [chadsoft](https://www.chadsoft.co.uk/) and elaborates it.  After that, the data gets uploaded in the database section of the Italian [Time Trial Leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pzvXA5NeHaqgaUe5ft_d4TauEbX9lVFxVp3dM51HsuA/edit#gid=0), which is a public Google Sheets file.

## What am I going to do?
In the future I would like to implement a system to automatize the updating process of the Flaps (short for Fast laps).  Though, they're stored in a different way inside the chadsoft database, so it won't be immediate.  In the short term, I will improve the user interface, add log files and the ability to automatically save the ghosts it finds.
